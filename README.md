# CoinToss README.MD file

### Hi, this is a short briefing on CoinToss, as you've probably read in the project description, CoinToss was partially created under the same idea as M8Ball, to write little code and to make a good purpose out of it. In the future, I'd look into making the projects be callable from the WebSending project I have been working on. That is, unless I decide to build a new CLI (Command Line Interface). Therefore, it would most likely would not be called "WebSending."

### Please be sure to read the comments in the main file of the project, which is CoinToss.java, as it explains rules and some other important information on the usage of this project.

## To use 
* Make sure java is installed on the computer you're using.
* Open up your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and run the CoinToss.java file.
* If you don't have an IDE or a debugger, copy the folder directory, open up Command prompt, terminal, or your preferred terminal, and input the following:
* 1: cd "folderdirectory"
* 2: java CoinToss
* 3: Start making bets on the coin flip!

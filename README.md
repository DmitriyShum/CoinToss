# CoinToss README.MD file

### Hi, this is a short briefing on CoinToss, as you've probably read in the project description, CoinToss was partially created under the same idea as M8Ball, to write little code and to make a good purpose out of it. In the future, I'd look into making the projects be callable from the WebSending project I have been working on. That is, unless I decide to build a new CLI (Command Line Interface). Therefore, it would most likely would not be called "WebSending."

### Please be sure to read the comments in the main file of the project, which is CoinToss.java, as it explains rules and some other important information on the usage of this project.
